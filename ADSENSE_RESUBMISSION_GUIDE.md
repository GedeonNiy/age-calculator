   - Once verified, go to "Sitemaps" in left menu
   - Enter: `https://smartagetools.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
   - Wait for Google to process (may take a few hours)

4. **Request Indexing (Optional but Recommended):**

   - Enter each important page URL:
     - https://smartagetools.com/
     - https://smartagetools.com/tools
     - https://smartagetools.com/about
     - Each of the 10 tool pages
   - Click "Request Indexing" for each
   - This helps Google discover your content faster

5. **Check Coverage:**
