# Google Search Console - Next Steps After Verification

**Status:** ✅ Site Verified

---

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Submit Your Sitemap (CRITICAL)

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Click "GO TO PROPERTY" (or navigate to your property)
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Sitemaps"** (under "Indexing")

2. **Add Your Sitemap:**
   - In the "Add a new sitemap" field, enter:
     ```
     sitemap.xml
     ```
   - Click **"Submit"**

3. **Wait for Processing:**
   - Google will process your sitemap (usually takes a few minutes to hours)
   - Status will show "Success" when done
   - This tells Google about all your pages (10 tools + static pages)

**Why This Matters:** AdSense reviewers may check if your site is properly indexed in Google. Having a submitted sitemap shows your site is ready.

### Step 2: Request Indexing for Key Pages (RECOMMENDED)

This helps Google discover your content faster:

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Click **"URL Inspection"** in the left sidebar (under "URLs")

2. **Request Indexing for These Pages:**
   - Enter each URL below and click "Request Indexing":
     - `https://smartagetools.com/`
     - `https://smartagetools.com/tools`
     - `https://smartagetools.com/about`
     - `https://smartagetools.com/age-calculator`
     - `https://smartagetools.com/bmi-calculator`
     - `https://smartagetools.com/mortgage-calculator`
     - (You can do all 10 tools, but at least do the homepage and a few key tools)

3. **Wait for Indexing:**
   - Each request may take a few minutes
   - Status will show "URL is on Google" when indexed

**Note:** You don't need to request all pages - Google will crawl them from the sitemap. But requesting key pages speeds things up.

### Step 3: Check Coverage Report (OPTIONAL)

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar (under "Indexing")
   - Review the "Not indexed" section
   - Fix any critical errors if present

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Most pages should be "Indexed"
- ⚠️ Some pages may show "Crawled - currently not indexed" (this is normal, they'll be indexed soon)
- ❌ If you see errors, fix them

---

## ⏱️ WAIT PERIOD (IMPORTANT)

### Step 4: Wait 24-48 Hours

**Before submitting to AdSense, wait 24-48 hours after:**
- ✅ Site verification
- ✅ Sitemap submission
- ✅ Initial indexing requests

**Why Wait:**
- Gives Google time to crawl and index your site
- Shows AdSense reviewers that your site is active and being indexed
- Improves your approval chances

**What to Do During Wait:**
- Monitor Search Console for indexing progress
- Test your site to ensure everything works
- Review your content one more time
- Prepare your AdSense application details
