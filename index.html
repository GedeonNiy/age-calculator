            <h2>What is an Age Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
              An age calculator is a useful tool that helps you determine your exact age or the age of someone else based on their date of birth. It calculates the precise number of years, months, and days that have passed since the birth date. This tool is particularly helpful for various purposes such as verifying age for legal requirements, planning events, tracking milestones, or simply satisfying curiosity about how old you are down to the exact day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our age calculator uses accurate date calculations to provide you with a detailed breakdown of your age. Simply enter your date of birth, and the calculator will instantly show you your age in years, months, and days from that date to today. The calculation accounts for leap years and varying month lengths to ensure accuracy.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Date Difference Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
              A date difference calculator is a practical tool that computes the time span between any two dates. Whether you need to know how many days until a deadline, how long a project has been running, or the duration between two significant events, this calculator provides you with the answer in multiple formats including days, weeks, months, and years.
            </p>
            <p>
              This calculator is invaluable for project planning, event organization, tracking durations, calculating interest periods, or any situation where you need to know the exact time difference between two dates. It handles all the complexities of calendar calculations, including leap years and months with different numbers of days, to give you accurate results.
            </p>

            <h3>How accurate are these calculators?</h3>
            <p>
              Our calculators use precise date arithmetic that accounts for leap years, varying month lengths (28-31 days), and all calendar complexities. The results are accurate to the day, making them suitable for both personal and professional use.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I calculate age for dates in the future?</h3>
            <p>
              The age calculator is designed to calculate age from a date of birth to the current date. If you enter a future date of birth, the calculator will show an error message, as age cannot be calculated for dates that haven't occurred yet.
            </p>

            <h3>What if the end date is before the start date?</h3>
            <p>
              For the date difference calculator, the end date must be equal to or after the start date. If you enter an end date that is before the start date, you'll receive an error message prompting you to correct the dates. This ensures logical and meaningful results.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Smart Age Tools is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect

          </p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            Our calculators operate entirely on your device (client-side), which means we do not collect, store, or transmit any 
            personal information or calculation data to our servers. All date calculations are performed locally in your web browser, 
            ensuring complete privacy and security of your data. We do not have access to any dates you enter or results you calculate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use our calculators. The only information 
            we may collect is aggregated, non-personally identifiable data through analytics tools.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Usage Data</h2>
          <p>
            We may use basic analytics tools to understand how visitors use our website, such as page views, general traffic patterns, 
            and which calculators are most popular. This aggregated information helps us improve our services and user experience. 
            This data does not include personally identifiable information.

            Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will not see ads. You will still see advertisements, 
            but they may be less relevant to your interests.
          </p>

          <h2>Log Files / Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            Like many websites, we may collect basic log file information, including IP addresses, browser types, referring pages, 
            and timestamps. This information is used for analyzing trends, administering the site, and gathering broad demographic 
            information. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify individual users.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Since we do not collect personal information through our calculators, there is no personal data to retain. Any aggregated 
            analytics data we collect is retained only as long as necessary to analyze website performance and improve our services.
          </p>

          <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
          <p>
            Our website may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will 
            be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. 
            We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party 
            sites or services.
          </p>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our website is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children 
            under 13. Our calculators are general information tools and are not specifically designed for children. If you are a parent 
            or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such 
            information from our records.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            Since all calculations are performed locally on your device, your data never leaves your computer or mobile device. 
            We do not have access to any dates you enter or results you calculate. This ensures maximum privacy and security. 
            However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee 
            absolute security of any information transmitted to us through other means (such as contact forms).
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. 
            We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued 
            use of our website after any changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
