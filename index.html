            <h2>How to Use the Age Calculator</h2>
            <p>Using our age calculator is simple and straightforward. Enter your date of birth in the field above, and click the "Calculate Age" button. The calculator will instantly display your exact age broken down into years, months, and days from your birth date to today's date. This precise calculation accounts for leap years and varying month lengths to ensure complete accuracy.</p>
            
            <h3>What is an Age Calculator?</h3>
            <p>An age calculator is a digital tool designed to determine your exact age or the age of another person based on their date of birth. Unlike simple year-based calculations, an age calculator provides a detailed breakdown showing precisely how many years, months, and days have elapsed since the birth date. This level of precision is essential for various legal, medical, and personal purposes where exact age matters.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Use an Age Calculator?</h3>
            <p>There are numerous situations where knowing your exact age is important. Legal requirements often demand precise age verification for activities like voting, driving, employment, or entering into contracts. Medical professionals use exact age calculations for proper diagnosis and treatment planning. Parents track their children's development milestones. Event planners need exact ages for birthday celebrations. Researchers and demographers use age data for statistical analysis. Our calculator handles all these needs with precision and ease.</p>
            
            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>Our age calculator uses sophisticated date arithmetic algorithms that account for all calendar complexities. It correctly handles leap years (including century years that are not leap years), months with different numbers of days (28, 29, 30, or 31 days), and ensures accurate calculations across different calendar periods. The algorithm calculates the difference between your birth date and today's date, then breaks it down into years, months, and remaining days for a complete picture of your age.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Legal Verification:</strong> Verify age for legal requirements, contracts, or age-restricted activities</li>
              <li><strong>Medical Purposes:</strong> Calculate exact age for medical records, prescriptions, or treatment planning</li>
              <li><strong>Event Planning:</strong> Determine exact age for birthday parties, anniversaries, or milestone celebrations</li>
              <li><strong>Personal Records:</strong> Track your age or family members' ages for personal documentation</li>
              <li><strong>Educational:</strong> Calculate age for school enrollment, grade placement, or educational milestones</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Accuracy and Reliability</h3>
            <p>Our age calculator is designed with precision in mind. It accounts for leap years, including the special rules for century years (years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're also divisible by 400). It correctly handles months with varying lengths and ensures accurate day calculations. The results are reliable and suitable for both personal and professional use, providing you with confidence in the accuracy of your age calculation.</p>
            
            <h3>Step-by-Step Guide: Calculating Your Age</h3>
            <ol class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Locate the date input field</strong> at the top of the calculator</li>
              <li><strong>Click on the date field</strong> to open the calendar picker</li>
              <li><strong>Navigate to your birth year</strong> using the year selector</li>
              <li><strong>Select your birth month</strong> from the calendar</li>
              <li><strong>Choose your birth day</strong> from the calendar grid</li>
              <li><strong>Click "Calculate Age"</strong> to see your exact age</li>
              <li><strong>Review the results</strong> showing years, months, and days</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Understanding Age Calculation Methods</h3>
            <p>There are different ways to calculate age, and understanding the method used is important for accuracy:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Chronological Age:</strong> This is the most common method, counting the exact time elapsed since birth. Our calculator uses this method, providing the most precise measurement.</li>
              <li><strong>Age in Years Only:</strong> Some calculations only count full years, ignoring months and days. Our calculator provides the complete breakdown.</li>
              <li><strong>Age at Next Birthday:</strong> Some systems count age as the number of birthdays you've had. Our calculator shows your current age, not your age at your next birthday.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Legal Age Verification</strong></p>
            <p>Sarah was born on March 15, 2005. Today is January 20, 2025. The calculator shows she is 19 years, 10 months, and 5 days old. This precise calculation is essential for legal purposes like voting eligibility or age-restricted activities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 2: Medical Records</strong></p>
            <p>For medical purposes, exact age matters. A patient born on June 10, 1980, on a visit date of December 5, 2024, would be 44 years, 5 months, and 25 days old. This level of precision helps healthcare providers make accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 3: School Enrollment</strong></p>
            <p>When enrolling a child in school, administrators need to know the exact age. A child born on September 1, 2018, on an enrollment date of August 15, 2024, would be 5 years, 11 months, and 14 days old. This determines grade placement and eligibility.</p>
            
            <h3>Leap Year Calculations Explained</h3>
            <p>Leap years add complexity to age calculations. Our calculator handles all leap year scenarios correctly:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Standard Leap Years:</strong> Years divisible by 4 are leap years (e.g., 2020, 2024, 2028)</li>
              <li><strong>Century Years:</strong> Years divisible by 100 are NOT leap years (e.g., 1900, 1800)</li>
              <li><strong>Century Leap Years:</strong> Years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g., 2000, 2400)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you were born on February 29 (a leap day), the calculator correctly handles your age calculation, counting your birthday as February 28 in non-leap years or February 29 in leap years.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Age Calculation Scenarios</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Age Verification for Employment:</strong> Many jobs have minimum age requirements. Our calculator provides the exact age needed for verification.</li>
              <li><strong>Insurance Calculations:</strong> Insurance companies often need precise age for policy calculations and premium determinations.</li>
              <li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> Knowing your exact age helps in retirement planning and understanding when you'll be eligible for benefits.</li>
              <li><strong>Sports and Activities:</strong> Age-based leagues and activities require precise age verification to ensure fair competition.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal Documents:</strong> Contracts, wills, and legal documents often require exact age verification.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Can I calculate age for a future date?</strong> No, the age calculator is designed to calculate age from a past birth date to today. If you enter a future date, you'll receive an error message.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Does it account for leap years?</strong> Yes, our calculator correctly handles all leap year scenarios, including century years. The algorithm accounts for the fact that years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're also divisible by 400.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How precise is the calculation?</strong> The calculator provides accuracy down to the exact day, accounting for all calendar complexities including leap years, varying month lengths, and century year rules.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I calculate someone else's age?</strong> Yes, you can enter any date of birth to calculate that person's age. The calculator works for any past date, not just your own birth date.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What if I don't know the exact birth date?</strong> For the most accurate results, you need the exact date of birth. However, if you only know the year, you can estimate by using January 1 of that year, though this will be less precise.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Does the calculator work for historical dates?</strong> Yes, the calculator works for any date in the past, including historical dates. It correctly handles dates going back centuries.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How does the calculator handle time zones?</strong> The calculator uses your local date (today's date) as the reference point. It doesn't account for time zones, so it calculates based on calendar days, not hours or minutes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Is my data stored or shared?</strong> No, all calculations are performed locally in your browser. We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information or calculation data.</p>

            <h2>Understanding BMI (Body Mass Index)</h2>
            <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a widely used screening tool that provides a numerical value based on a person's height and weight. It's calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters, or using pounds and inches with a conversion factor. While BMI doesn't directly measure body fat, it's a useful indicator of body composition and potential health risks associated with weight.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This BMI Calculator</h3>
            <p>Our BMI calculator is simple to use. First, select your preferred unit system - metric (kilograms and centimeters) or imperial (pounds, feet, and inches). Enter your weight and height in the appropriate fields. For imperial measurements, enter your height in feet and inches separately. Click "Calculate BMI" and the calculator will instantly display your BMI value along with your weight category classification.</p>
            
            <h3>BMI Categories Explained</h3>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations have established standard BMI categories to help classify weight status:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI below 18.5 - May indicate insufficient body weight for optimal health</li>
              <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> BMI 18.5 to 24.9 - Generally considered a healthy weight range</li>
              <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI 25 to 29.9 - May indicate excess body weight</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity Class I:</strong> BMI 30 to 34.9 - Moderate obesity</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity Class II:</strong> BMI 35 to 39.9 - Severe obesity</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity Class III:</strong> BMI 40 or higher - Extreme or morbid obesity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why BMI Matters for Health</h3>
            <p>BMI is an important health indicator because it correlates with various health outcomes. Research has shown that BMI outside the normal range (both too high and too low) can be associated with increased health risks. High BMI is linked to conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers, sleep apnea, and joint problems. Low BMI may indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or other underlying health issues. However, BMI is just one tool in assessing health and should be used alongside other measurements and professional medical advice.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding BMI Limitations</h3>
            <p>While BMI is a useful screening tool, it has important limitations. BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass. Athletes and individuals with high muscle mass may have a high BMI despite having low body fat and being in excellent physical condition. Similarly, older adults may have a normal BMI but higher body fat percentage due to age-related muscle loss. BMI also doesn't account for bone density, body frame size, or fat distribution (where fat is stored on the body). For these reasons, BMI should be considered alongside other health indicators like waist circumference, body composition analysis, and overall fitness level.</p>
            
            <h3>When to Consult a Healthcare Professional</h3>
            <p>If your BMI falls outside the normal range, or if you have concerns about your weight and health, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional. A doctor or registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance based on your individual health status, medical history, and lifestyle factors. They can help you develop a safe and effective plan for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight if needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Using BMI for Health Goals</h3>
            <p>BMI can be a useful starting point for setting health and fitness goals. If your BMI indicates you're outside the healthy range, working with healthcare professionals to develop a gradual, sustainable approach to weight management is recommended. This typically involves a combination of balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management. Remember that small, consistent changes over time are more effective and sustainable than drastic measures.</p>
            
            <h3>Step-by-Step Guide: Calculating Your BMI</h3>
            <ol class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Choose your unit system</strong> - Select either Metric (kg, cm) or Imperial (lbs, ft/in)</li>
              <li><strong>For Metric:</strong> Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters</li>
              <li><strong>For Imperial:</strong> Enter your weight in pounds, and height in feet and inches separately</li>
              <li><strong>Double-check your entries</strong> to ensure accuracy</li>
              <li><strong>Click "Calculate BMI"</strong> to see your result</li>
              <li><strong>Review your BMI value</strong> and weight category classification</li>
              <li><strong>Consult with a healthcare professional</strong> if you have concerns about your results</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Understanding BMI Formula</h3>
            <p>The BMI formula is simple but important to understand:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Metric Formula:</strong> BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height (m)²</li>
              <li><strong>Imperial Formula:</strong> BMI = (weight (lbs) ÷ height (in)²) × 703</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formula uses your weight divided by the square of your height, which accounts for the fact that taller people naturally weigh more. The 703 multiplier in the imperial formula converts the result to match the metric calculation.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Metric Calculation</strong></p>
            <p>A person weighs 70 kg and is 175 cm tall. Converting height to meters: 175 cm = 1.75 m. BMI = 70 ÷ (1.75)² = 70 ÷ 3.0625 = 22.86. This falls in the "Normal weight" category (18.5-24.9).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 2: Imperial Calculation</strong></p>
            <p>A person weighs 160 lbs, is 5 feet 8 inches tall (68 inches total). BMI = (160 ÷ 68²) × 703 = (160 ÷ 4,624) × 703 = 0.0346 × 703 = 24.33. This is in the "Normal weight" category.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 3: Understanding Results</strong></p>
            <p>If someone calculates their BMI as 28.5, this falls in the "Overweight" category (25-29.9). This doesn't mean they're unhealthy, but it may indicate they could benefit from lifestyle changes. A healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance.</p>
            
            <h3>BMI vs. Other Health Measurements</h3>
            <p>BMI is just one tool in assessing health. Here's how it compares to other measurements:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Waist Circumference:</strong> Measures abdominal fat, which is a better predictor of health risks than BMI alone</li>
              <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> More accurate than BMI for athletes and muscular individuals</li>
              <li><strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio:</strong> Helps assess fat distribution, which affects health risks</li>
              <li><strong>Muscle Mass:</strong> BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat, which is why athletes may have high BMI despite being healthy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>BMI for Different Populations</h3>
            <p>BMI categories are generally the same for adults, but there are important considerations:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Children and Teens:</strong> BMI is calculated differently and compared to growth charts specific to age and sex</li>
              <li><strong>Elderly Adults:</strong> Slightly higher BMI may be acceptable due to age-related muscle loss</li>
              <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> High muscle mass can result in high BMI despite low body fat</li>
              <li><strong>Pregnant Women:</strong> BMI categories don't apply during pregnancy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Common Misconceptions About BMI</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Myth:</strong> BMI is always accurate for everyone. <strong>Reality:</strong> BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnostic measure. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution.</li>
              <li><strong>Myth:</strong> A high BMI always means you're unhealthy. <strong>Reality:</strong> Athletes and muscular individuals may have high BMI but be in excellent health.</li>
              <li><strong>Myth:</strong> BMI is the only measure you need. <strong>Reality:</strong> BMI should be used alongside other health indicators like blood pressure, cholesterol, and fitness level.</li>
              <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You can't be healthy with a BMI outside the normal range. <strong>Reality:</strong> Health is multifaceted. Some people with BMI outside normal range are healthy, while some within normal range may have health issues.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>What is a healthy BMI range?</strong> For adults, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally considered normal weight. However, this is a guideline, and individual health varies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can BMI be inaccurate for athletes?</strong> Yes, athletes with high muscle mass may have a high BMI despite having low body fat and being in excellent health. BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Should children use the same BMI categories?</strong> No, children and teens need age and sex-specific BMI percentiles. The standard adult categories don't apply to growing children.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How often should I check my BMI?</strong> There's no set frequency, but checking monthly or quarterly can help track changes. However, focus on overall health, not just BMI numbers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I use BMI if I'm pregnant?</strong> BMI categories don't apply during pregnancy. Your healthcare provider will monitor your weight gain based on pregnancy-specific guidelines.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What if my BMI is in the overweight category?</strong> Being in the overweight category doesn't necessarily mean you're unhealthy.

            <p><strong>Does BMI account for where I carry my weight?</strong> No, BMI doesn't consider fat distribution. Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio are better indicators of where you carry weight, which affects health risks.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Is BMI the same for men and women?</strong> The BMI formula and categories are the same, but women naturally tend to have higher body fat percentages than men at the same BMI level.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Mortgage Payment</h2>
            <p>A mortgage payment is more complex than many people realize. It consists of several components that work together to determine your total monthly housing cost. The principal is the original amount you borrow to purchase the home. Interest is the cost of borrowing money, calculated as a percentage of the remaining loan balance. Property taxes are assessed by local governments and typically paid monthly through an escrow account. Homeowner's insurance protects your property and is usually required by lenders. PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is required when your down payment is less than 20% of the home price. HOA (Homeowners Association) fees apply if you live in a community with shared amenities and services.</p>
            
            <h3>How Mortgage Payments Work</h3>
            <p>Mortgage payments are calculated using an amortization formula that ensures your loan is paid off over the specified term. In the early years of your mortgage, a larger portion of each payment goes toward interest, while a smaller portion reduces the principal. As time passes and the principal balance decreases, more of each payment goes toward principal and less toward interest. This is why making extra principal payments early in the loan term can have such a significant impact on total interest paid.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Mortgage Terms Explained</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The original amount you borrow to purchase the home. This is the base amount you'll repay over the loan term.</li>
              <li><strong>Interest Rate (APR):</strong> The annual percentage rate you pay on the loan. This determines how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.</li>
              <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> The upfront amount you pay toward the home purchase. A larger down payment reduces your loan amount and may eliminate PMI.</li>
              <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> The length of time you have to repay the loan, typically 15, 20, or 30 years. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest.</li>
              <li><strong>PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance):</strong> Insurance that protects the lender if you default. Required when down payment is less than 20%.</li>
              <li><strong>Escrow:</strong> An account where your lender holds funds for property taxes and insurance, paying them on your behalf.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Power of Extra Payments</h3>
            <p>Making extra principal payments can dramatically reduce the total interest you pay over the life of your loan and shorten your loan term. For example, adding just $100 per month to a $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 6.5% interest can save over $50,000 in interest and pay off the loan more than 5 years early. The earlier you make extra payments, the greater the impact, because you're reducing the principal balance while interest rates are still high. Even small, consistent extra payments can make a significant difference over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Total Monthly Payment</h3>
            <p>Your total monthly mortgage payment includes more than just principal and interest. Property taxes vary by location and are typically 1-2% of the home's value annually. Homeowner's insurance costs depend on factors like home value, location, and coverage level. PMI typically costs 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually until you reach 20% equity. HOA fees vary widely based on community amenities. Understanding all these components helps you budget accurately and make informed decisions about your home purchase.</p>
            
            <h3>Using This Calculator Effectively</h3>
            <p>Our mortgage calculator helps you understand the full cost of homeownership. Enter your home price, down payment amount or percentage, loan term, and interest rate. Include property taxes, insurance, PMI if applicable, and HOA fees to see your complete monthly payment.

            <h3>Understanding Mortgage Components</h3>
            <p>A mortgage payment consists of several parts, and understanding each helps you budget accurately:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The amount borrowed to purchase the home. This is the base amount you'll repay over the loan term.</li>
              <li><strong>Interest:</strong> The cost of borrowing money, calculated as a percentage of the remaining loan balance. Interest is higher in early years.</li>
              <li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong> Local government taxes assessed on property value, typically 1-2% annually, paid monthly through escrow.</li>
              <li><strong>Homeowner's Insurance:</strong> Protects your property from damage, usually required by lenders, paid monthly through escrow.</li>
              <li><strong>PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance):</strong> Required when down payment is less than 20%, typically 0.5-1% of loan amount annually.</li>
              <li><strong>HOA Fees:</strong> Monthly fees for community amenities and services, if applicable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Standard 30-Year Mortgage</strong></p>
            <p>A $350,000 home with 20% down ($70,000), 30-year term, 6.5% interest rate, 1.2% property tax, $1,200 annual insurance, and $100 monthly HOA. Monthly P&I: $1,770. Total monthly payment: $2,720. Total interest over 30 years: $337,200.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 2: 15-Year Mortgage with Extra Payments</strong></p>
            <p>Same $350,000 home with 20% down, but 15-year term at 6.0% interest. Monthly P&I: $2,366. Adding $200 extra monthly principal payment saves $45,000 in interest and pays off 2 years early.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example 3: Low Down Payment with PMI</strong></p>
            <p>A $300,000 home with 10% down ($30,000), 30-year term, 6.75% interest. Monthly P&I: $1,746. PMI adds $125/month. Total monthly payment: $2,471. PMI can be removed once equity reaches 20%.</p>
            
            <h3>Mortgage Payment Calculation Formula</h3>
            <p>The monthly principal and interest payment is calculated using the standard amortization formula:</p>
            <p><strong>M = P × [r(1+r)ⁿ] / [(1+r)ⁿ - 1]</strong></p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>M</strong> = Monthly payment</li>
              <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal loan amount</li>
              <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)</li>
              <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of payments (years × 12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This formula ensures your loan is paid off exactly at the end of the term, with interest calculated on the remaining balance each month.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Amortization</h3>
            <p>Amortization is how your loan balance decreases over time:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Early Years:</strong> Most of your payment goes toward interest (70-80%), with only 20-30% reducing principal</li>
              <li><strong>Middle Years:</strong> The balance shifts, with roughly equal amounts going to interest and principal</li>
              <li><strong>Final Years:</strong> Most of your payment goes toward principal (70-80%), with only 20-30% for interest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is why making extra principal payments early in the loan has such a significant impact - you're reducing the balance while interest rates are still high.</p>
            
            <h3>Down Payment Strategies</h3>
            <p>Your down payment affects your mortgage in several ways:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>20% or More:</strong> Eliminates PMI, reduces loan amount, lowers monthly payment, and may qualify for better interest rates</li>
              <li><strong>10-19%:</strong> Requires PMI, but allows home purchase with less upfront cash. PMI can be removed once equity reaches 20%</li>
              <li><strong>Less than 10%:</strong> Higher PMI costs, larger loan amount, higher monthly payments. Some programs allow 3-5% down</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Interest Rate Impact</h3>
            <p>Even small changes in interest rates significantly affect your mortgage:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>0.5% Rate Difference:</strong> On a $300,000 loan, 6.0% vs 6.5% adds $89/month and $32,000 total interest over 30 years</li>
              <li><strong>1% Rate Difference:</strong> On a $400,000 loan, 6.0% vs 7.0% adds $238/month and $85,680 total interest</li>
              <li><strong>Rate Shopping:</strong> Getting quotes from multiple lenders can save thousands over the loan term</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Extra Payment Strategies</h3>
            <p>Making extra principal payments can dramatically reduce your total interest:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Consistent Extra Payments:</strong> Adding $100-200 monthly can save $30,000-60,000 in interest</li>
              <li><strong>Annual Lump Sum:</strong> Making one extra payment per year can shorten your loan by 4-5 years</li>
              <li><strong>Bi-weekly Payments:</strong> Paying half your monthly payment every two weeks results in 13 full payments per year</li>
              <li><strong>Early Payment Impact:</strong> Extra payments in the first 5 years have the greatest impact on total interest</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>What's the difference between APR and interest rate?</strong> The interest rate is the cost of borrowing, while APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate plus other loan costs like origination fees, giving you the true cost of the loan.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How is PMI calculated?</strong> PMI is typically 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually, divided into monthly payments. It's required when your down payment is less than 20%.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I remove PMI before paying 20%?</strong> In some cases, yes. You can request PMI removal once your home value increases enough to give you 20% equity, or you can refinance when rates are favorable.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?</strong> A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but saves significantly on interest. A 30-year mortgage offers lower monthly payments and more flexibility. Choose based on your financial situation and goals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How do property taxes affect my payment?</strong> Property taxes are typically 1-2% of home value annually, paid monthly through an escrow account. They can increase over time as property values rise.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What happens if I make extra payments?</strong> Extra payments go directly toward principal, reducing your loan balance faster. This saves interest and can shorten your loan term significantly.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I change my mortgage terms after closing?</strong> You can refinance your mortgage to change terms, but this involves closing costs. You can also make extra payments without refinancing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How accurate is this calculator?</strong> The calculator provides accurate estimates based on standard mortgage formulas. Actual payments may vary slightly based on your specific loan terms, closing costs, and lender fees.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's included in the total monthly payment?</strong> The total includes principal, interest, property taxes, homeowner's insurance, PMI (if applicable), and HOA fees (if entered).</p>

            <h2>Understanding Compound Interest</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means your money grows faster over time because you earn interest on both your original investment and the interest you've already earned. It's often called "interest on interest" and is one of the most powerful concepts in personal finance.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
            <p>Enter your initial investment amount (principal), any monthly contributions you plan to make, the annual interest rate you expect to earn, the number of years you'll invest, and how often interest compounds. Click "Calculate" to see how your investment will grow over time. The calculator shows your final balance, total contributions, total interest earned, and a year-by-year breakdown.</p>
            
            <h3>The Power of Compounding</h3>
            <p>Compound interest works best over long periods. The longer you invest, the more dramatic the growth becomes. For example, investing $10,000 at 5% annual interest for 10 years yields $16,289, but for 20 years it yields $26,533 - more than double. Adding monthly contributions amplifies this effect significantly.</p>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>What's the difference between simple and compound interest?</strong> Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus previously earned interest, leading to exponential growth.</p>
            <p><strong>How does compounding frequency affect returns?</strong> More frequent compounding (daily vs. monthly) results in slightly higher returns because interest is calculated and added more often.</p>
            <p><strong>Should I contribute monthly or make a lump sum?</strong> Regular monthly contributions often yield better results due to dollar-cost averaging and more time in the market, though a large lump sum upfront can also be powerful.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Car Loans</h2>
            <p>A car loan allows you to purchase a vehicle by borrowing money and repaying it over time with interest. Understanding your loan terms helps you make informed decisions about your purchase and potentially save thousands in interest payments.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
            <p>Enter the vehicle price, your down payment, trade-in value (if applicable), sales tax rate, loan term in months, interest rate, and start date. Optionally add extra monthly payments to see how they reduce your total interest. The calculator shows your monthly payment, total interest, and payoff date.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Factors Affecting Your Payment</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> A larger down payment reduces your loan amount and monthly payment</li>
              <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest</li>
              <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Your credit score and market rates determine your interest rate</li>
              <li><strong>Trade-In Value:</strong> Your old vehicle's value reduces the amount you need to finance</li>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>What's a good interest rate for a car loan?</strong> Rates vary by credit score, but rates under 5% are generally considered good. Rates above 10% may indicate poor credit or high-risk loans.</p>
            <p><strong>Should I get a longer or shorter loan term?</strong> Shorter terms save interest but require higher monthly payments. Choose based on what you can comfortably afford monthly.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I pay off my car loan early?</strong> Yes, but check for prepayment penalties. Most lenders allow early payoff, which saves interest.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Pregnancy Due Dates</h2>
            <p>A pregnancy due date is an estimated date when a baby is expected to be born. It's calculated from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) and assumes a 40-week (280-day) pregnancy. Most babies are born between 38-42 weeks, with only about 5% born exactly on their due date.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
            <p>Enter the first day of your last menstrual period and your average cycle length. The calculator uses Naegele's rule, which adds 280 days (40 weeks) to your LMP date. It also shows your current gestational age, which trimester you're in, and important milestone dates.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Gestational Age</h3>
            <p>Gestational age is measured from the first day of your last menstrual period, not from conception. This is because the exact date of conception is often unknown. A full-term pregnancy is typically 37-40 weeks, with most babies born between 39-40 weeks.</p>
            
            <h3>Pregnancy Trimesters</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>First Trimester:</strong> Weeks 1-12 (months 1-3)</li>
              <li><strong>Second Trimester:</strong> Weeks 13-27 (months 4-6)</li>
              <li><strong>Third Trimester:</strong> Weeks 28-40 (months 7-9)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>How accurate is the due date?</strong> Due dates are estimates. Only about 5% of babies are born exactly on their due date. Most are born within two weeks before or after.</p>
            <p><strong>What if my cycle is irregular?</strong> If your cycles vary significantly, an ultrasound in early pregnancy can provide a more accurate due date.</p>
            <p><strong>Can the due date change?</strong> Yes, healthcare providers may adjust the due date based on early ultrasounds or other factors.</p>

            <h2>Understanding GPA (Grade Point Average)</h2>
            <p>GPA is a numerical representation of your academic performance, calculated by averaging the grade points earned across all courses. It's used by schools, colleges, and employers to assess academic achievement. Most schools use a 4.0 scale, where A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
            <p>Click "Add Course" to add a new course. Enter the course name (optional), number of credits, and select the grade. Add as many courses as needed, then click "Calculate GPA" to see your overall GPA. The calculator weights each course by its credit hours, so a 3-credit A has more impact than a 1-credit A.</p>
            
            <h3>How GPA is Calculated</h3>
            <p>GPA is calculated by: (Sum of (Grade Points × Credits)) ÷ Total Credits. For example, if you have an A (4.0) in a 3-credit course and a B (3.0) in a 2-credit course: (4.0 × 3 + 3.0 × 2) ÷ 5 = 18 ÷ 5 = 3.6 GPA.</p>
            
            <h3>GPA Scales</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>4.0 Scale:</strong> Most common in the US. A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0</li>
              <li><strong>Weighted GPA:</strong> Some schools add extra points for honors/AP courses (A=5.0, B=4.0, etc.)</li>
              <li><strong>Percentage Scale:</strong> Some schools use percentages (90-100% = A, 80-89% = B, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>What's a good GPA?</strong> A GPA of 3.0 or higher is generally considered good. For competitive programs, 3.5+ may be required. A 4.0 is perfect.</p>
            <p><strong>How do I improve my GPA?</strong> Focus on earning higher grades in future courses, especially those with more credits. Retaking courses with low grades can also help.</p>
            <p><strong>Does this calculator work for weighted GPA?</strong> This calculator uses a standard 4.0 scale. For weighted GPA, you may need to manually adjust grade points for honors/AP courses.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Income Tax</h2>
            <p>Income tax is a tax imposed on individuals' income by the federal government and most states. The U.S. uses a progressive tax system, meaning higher income is taxed at higher rates. Understanding how much tax you'll pay helps with financial planning and budgeting.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Tax Brackets</h3>
            <p>The U.S. tax system uses marginal tax brackets. This means different portions of your income are taxed at different rates. For example, if you're single and earn $50,000, the first portion is taxed at 10%, the next at 12%, and so on. You don't pay the top rate on all your income.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Currency Conversion</h2>
            <p>Currency conversion is the process of exchanging one currency for another at a specific exchange rate. Exchange rates fluctuate constantly based on economic factors, market conditions, and geopolitical events. Understanding exchange rates helps with international travel, business transactions, and investment decisions.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Use This Converter</h3>
            <p>Enter the amount you want to convert, select the source currency (from), and the target currency (to). Click "Convert" to see the converted amount. The calculator uses current or recent exchange rates to provide accurate conversions. It also shows the exchange rate and inverse rate for reference.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Exchange Rates</h3>
            <p>An exchange rate tells you how much of one currency you need to buy one unit of another currency. For example, if USD/EUR = 0.85, you need $0.85 to buy €1. Exchange rates change constantly, so rates shown are estimates based on recent market data.</p>
            
            <h3>Factors Affecting Exchange Rates</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Higher interest rates often strengthen a currency</li>
              <li><strong>Economic Performance:</strong> Strong economies typically have stronger currencies</li>
              <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> High inflation can weaken a currency</li>
              <li><strong>Political Stability:</strong> Political uncertainty can affect currency values</li>
              <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Investor confidence impacts currency demand</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>How accurate are these exchange rates?</strong> Rates are based on recent market data but may not reflect real-time rates. For actual transactions, check with banks or currency exchange services.</p>
            <p><strong>Do banks use the same rates?</strong> No, banks and exchange services add margins and fees, so you'll typically get slightly different rates than the market rate.</p>
            <p><strong>Why do exchange rates change?</strong> Exchange rates fluctuate based on supply and demand, economic indicators, central bank policies, and global events.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Exchange rates are estimates for informational purposes. Actual rates for transactions may vary. Always verify rates with your bank or currency exchange service before making transactions.</p>
