            <h2>What is an Age Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
              An age calculator is a useful tool that helps you determine your exact age or the age of someone else based on their date of birth. It calculates the precise number of years, months, and days that have passed since the birth date. This tool is particularly helpful for various purposes such as verifying age for legal requirements, planning events, tracking milestones, or simply satisfying curiosity about how old you are down to the exact day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our age calculator uses accurate date calculations to provide you with a detailed breakdown of your age. Simply enter your date of birth, and the calculator will instantly show you your age in years, months, and days from that date to today. The calculation accounts for leap years and varying month lengths to ensure accuracy.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Date Difference Calculator?</h2>
            <p>
              A date difference calculator is a practical tool that computes the time span between any two dates. Whether you need to know how many days until a deadline, how long a project has been running, or the duration between two significant events, this calculator provides you with the answer in multiple formats including days, weeks, months, and years.
            </p>
            <p>
              This calculator is invaluable for project planning, event organization, tracking durations, calculating interest periods, or any situation where you need to know the exact time difference between two dates. It handles all the complexities of calendar calculations, including leap years and months with different numbers of days, to give you accurate results.
            </p>

            <h3>How accurate are these calculators?</h3>
            <p>
              Our calculators use precise date arithmetic that accounts for leap years, varying month lengths (28-31 days), and all calendar complexities. The results are accurate to the day, making them suitable for both personal and professional use.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I calculate age for dates in the future?</h3>
            <p>
              The age calculator is designed to calculate age from a date of birth to the current date. If you enter a future date of birth, the calculator will show an error message, as age cannot be calculated for dates that haven't occurred yet.
            </p>

            <h3>What if the end date is before the start date?</h3>
            <p>
              For the date difference calculator, the end date must be equal to or after the start date. If you enter an end date that is before the start date, you'll receive an error message prompting you to correct the dates. This ensures logical and meaningful results.
